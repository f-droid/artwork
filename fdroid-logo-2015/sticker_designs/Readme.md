### Stickers


#### Design

All designs should be editable in Inkscape.


#### Production

All but the hexagons stickers were produced at [flyeralarm](https://flyeralarm.com) in
December 2019.

The hexagon stickers were produced somewhere in the Netherlands, but next time
we need a better production that is a bit thicker.

Stickers can be produced by [stickermule](https://www.stickermule.com/) for
free after contacting them to sponsor our FOSS project. The hexagon sticker will
be as is. For other stickers, they can add a tear-off strip on the front at the
bottom with the text "Made with ♥ by stickermule" URL to inform that they
sponsored the production.

It is also possible to have stickers produced at other sticker printers, but
they have less experience with hexagon stickers and the quality of stickermule
is very good and they don't damage laptop lids. Contact the production company
beforehand, because some only accept designs in centimeters.

Note: this is in no way advertisement for flyeralarm or sticker Mule, just
pratical information. If other sticker printers are noteworthy, please add these
here too.
